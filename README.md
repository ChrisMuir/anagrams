anagrams
========

`anagrams` is a super simple R package providing a function for comparing character vectors and determining if strings are [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) of one another. The project was inspired by [this](http://www.programmingr.com/content/simple-anagram-finder-using-r/) blog post on finding anagrams in R. The package uses C++ and [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) for speed.

Installation
------------

Install from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ChrisMuir/anagrams")
```

Example Usage
-------------

The exported function `is_anagram` takes as input a string and a character vector, and returns a logical vector with length equal to that of the character vector.

``` r
library(anagrams)

# Test for anagrams that are the same length as the input string.
is_anagram("cats", c("cats are great", "tacs", "frogs", "cats", "ts"))
#> [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

# Set arg "any_len" to TRUE to test for anagrams that are any length (either same length or sub-string).
is_anagram("cats", c("cats are great", "tacs", "frogs", "cats", "ts"), any_len = TRUE)
#> [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
```
